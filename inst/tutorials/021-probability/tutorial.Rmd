<!-- DK: This tutorial sucks! We need to rethink what goes here and why. And, in conjunction, we need -->

<!-- DK: Change mayor example to be Parisians overhearing Arabic. Need question to be close to the data. -->

<!-- DK: Build up questions to Preceptor Table slowly. First, causal or predictive? First, what are the units. Second, what is the outcome? Third, what are the covariates? Fourth, only if causal, what are the treatments. -->

<!-- MAKE THIS MATCH THE NEW VERSION OF THE PRIMER. The stuff we have is good, but there is nothing about the Cardinal Virtues. -->

<!-- Tricks to keep in mind when doing simulations in R: First, organize everything in a tibble. This makes it easy to see what is going on. Often, we will first make sure that the code is working with a small tibble with just a few rows and selected values for the key variables. Then, when that looks good, run it for real with x = 1:100 or whatever. -->

<!-- Second, build the tibble column-by-column. We will often start with an ID column whose only purpose is to set up the size of the tibble. Then, we add new columns with mutate(). Often, we add one column and then use that column as input to a map function which adds another column and then use that column to do something else. Read the examples in Chapter 6 closely. -->

<!-- Third, recall that map() returns a list, which allows you to create a list-column. This is very handy. Let's say you want to get the sum of 6 rolls from a dice. Instead of doing a roll in each row and then summing the rows --- which can work but which can also be a bother --- use something like `mutate(six_rolls = map(ID, ~  roll_die(n = 6))` to get a list of the 6 rolls. You can then manipulate six rolls, which is a list-column, in subsequent steps. -->


## Introduction
### 

This tutorial covers [Chapter 2: Probability](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/probability.html) of [*Preceptor’s Primer for Bayesian Data Science: Using the Cardinal Virtues for Inference*](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/) by [David Kane](https://davidkane.info/). 


## Distributions
### 

<!-- DK: This plot is not good. Needs labels for the legend. -->

Let's create this normal distribution by the end of this section.

```{r distributions-0}
shoesize_p <- tibble(Wshoes = rnorm(n = 100000, mean = 8, sd = 1.5),
       Mshoes = rnorm(n = 100000, mean = 10.5, sd = 1.5)) |> 
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), 
               names_to = "distribution", 
               values_to = "value") |>  
   ggplot(aes(x = value, fill = distribution)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))),
                   alpha = 0.5, 
                   bins = 100, 
                   position = "identity") +
    labs(title = "Normal Distributions of shoe sizes",
         x = "Value",
         y = "Probability")

shoesize_p
```

### Exercise 1

Use `tibble()` to create a tibble with one variable: `numbers`, and set `numbers` equal to the consecutive integers from 1 to 101 inclusive using `:`.

```{r distributions-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r distributions-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
tibble(... = 1:101)
```

```{r distributions-1-test, include = FALSE}
tibble(numbers = 1:101)
```

### 

Note that the vector of `numbers` is integers, if you try putting `c()` around the two numbers, and
replace `:` with `,`, the two numbers become `double` instead.

### Exercise 2

Pipe the results to `summarize()`, create a new column name `avg` which is equal to the `mean()` of `numbers`.

```{r distributions-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r distributions-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...|>
  summarize(avg = mean(...))
```

```{r distributions-2-test, include = FALSE}
tibble(numbers = 1:101) |> 
  summarize(avg = mean(numbers))
```

### 

`summarize()` does not keep any of the variables in the input tibble, unless the `.by` argument is used.


### Exercise 3

Within the `summarize()`, add a new argument, `middle`, and set it equal to the `median()` of `numbers`. Remember to use commas to separate your arguments.

```{r distributions-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r distributions-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  summarize(...,
            middle = median(...))
```

```{r distributions-3-test, include = FALSE}
tibble(numbers = 1:101) |> 
  summarize(avg = mean(numbers),
            middle = median(numbers))
```

### 

Both `mean()` and `median()` have the `na.rm` value set to its default `FALSE`, the `na.rm` means the function does not consider NA value in the tibble.

### Exercise 4

Within the `summarize()`, add a new argument, `stan_dev`, set it equal to the standard deviation of `numbers` using `sd()`.



```{r distributions-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r distributions-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  summarize(...,
            ...,
            stan_dev = sd(...))
```

```{r distributions-4-test, include = FALSE}
tibble(numbers = 1:101) |> 
  summarize(avg = mean(numbers),
            middle = median(numbers),
            stan_dev = sd(numbers))
```

### 

Note that the `x` value inside `mean()` ,`median()` and `sd()` has to be a numeric vector, not a factor or logical. 

Recall standard deviation is measuring how spread out our numbers are.

### Exercise 5

Within the `summarize()`, add a new argument, `med_dev` and set it equal to `mad(numbers)`. 

```{r distributions-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r distributions-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  summarize(...,
            ...,
            ...,
            med_dev = mad(...))
```

```{r distributions-5-test, include = FALSE}
tibble(numbers = 1:101) |> 
  summarize(avg = mean(numbers),
            middle = median(numbers),
            stan_dev = sd(numbers),
            med_dev = mad(numbers))
```

### 

`mad` stands for median absolute deviation, essentially it's how spread out the values are around the median, note that the number should be different in this case. `sd()` is looking for the square of difference, yet `mad()` is looking at the absolute difference.

### Exercise 6

Last but not least, within `summarize()`, set `qtile` to `quantile()`. Within it, set the first argument to `numbers`, and the second to `prob` which is equal to `c(0, 0.5, 1)`.

```{r distributions-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r distributions-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
  summarize(...,
            ...,
            ...,
            ..., 
            qtile = quantile(..., prob = c(..., ..., ...)))

```

```{r distributions-6-test, include = FALSE}
tibble(numbers = 1:101) |> 
  summarize(avg = mean(numbers),
            middle = median(numbers),
            stan_dev = sd(numbers),
            med_dev = mad(numbers), 
            qtile = quantile(numbers, prob = c(0, 0.5, 1)))

```

### 

This will create another two rows, because quantile has three values in it's column, yet if we want to keep it in one row, we can add `list()` around `quantile()`, so that we create a list-column for column quantile and keep everything else in 1 row.


### Exercise 7

Create a new tibble. Make the first column name as `ID`, and set it equal to all the consecutive integers from 1 to 100. Then make a second column named `scores`, and set it equal to a vector `c()`. Inside the vector use `rep()` to make value `1350` occur 20 times, value `1380` occur 30 times, `1440` occur 40 times, and `1520` occur 10 times.



```{r distributions-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r distributions-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
tibble(... = 1:100 , scores = c(rep(..., 20),
                                rep(1380, ...),
                                rep(1440, ...),
                                rep(1520, ...)))
```

```{r distributions-7-test, include = FALSE}
tibble(ID = 1:100 , scores = c(rep(1350, 20),
                               rep(1380, 30),
                               rep(1440, 40),
                               rep(1520, 10)))
```

### 

We can use `c()` to combine the `rep()` of numbers into vectors, and within `tibble()` or `mutate()` we can turn this vector into a column.

### Exercise 8

<!-- AC: a) I got a warning about using reframe() instead of summarize, and b) is it supposed to be c(.35, .50, .75) or c(.25, .50, .75)? -->

Now let's say you are an admissions officer, and here's the score, now you want to look at the percentile of that score. After the previous code, pipe the `summarize()` function to make a new column `percentile`, and set equal to `quantile()`, first argument is `scores`, the second is `prob`, and set it equal to `c(.35, .50, .75)`.

```{r distributions-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r distributions-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |>
      summarize(percentile = quantile(scores, prob = c(..., ..., ...)))
```

```{r distributions-8-test, include = FALSE}
tibble(ID = 1:100 , 
       scores = c(rep(1350, 20),
                               rep(1380, 30),
                               rep(1440, 40),
                               rep(1520, 10))) |> 
                               summarize(percentile = quantile(scores, prob = c(.35, .50, .75)))
```

### 

The function `quantile()` produces sample quantiles corresponding to the given probabilities. The smallest observation corresponds to a probability of 0 and the largest to a probability of 1.

### Exercise 9

<!-- AC: Again, I got the warning of using reframe() instead of summarise() -->

Now let's say instead of looking at the percentile you want to randomly pick 10 people from 1350 to 1520 score range to admit. Within `summarize()`, replace `percentile` with `admit`, and set it equal to `sample()`. Within `sample()`, set the first argument to `scores`, second to `size` equal to `10`, and third to `replace` which you set to `FALSE`.

```{r distributions-9, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r distributions-9-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |>
      summarize(..., 
                percentile = quantile(scores, prob = c(..., ... = ..., ... = ...)))
```

```{r distributions-9-test, include = FALSE}
tibble(ID = 1:100 , 
       scores = c(rep(1350, 20),
                               rep(1380, 30),
                               rep(1440, 40),
                               rep(1520, 10))) |> 
                               summarize(admit = sample(scores, size = 10, replace = FALSE))
```

### 

Within `sample()`, the first argument represents the data source, `size` means the number of values we are picking, and `replace` means whether we pick the same value twice.

### Exercise 10

Let's now use `runif()` to draw from a uniform distribution. Within `runif()`, set `n` to 5 (the number of draws), `min` to 5, and `max` to 8. 

```{r distributions-10, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r distributions-10-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
runif(n = ..., 
      min = ..., 
      max =...)
```

```{r distributions-10-test, include = FALSE}
runif(n = 5, min = 5, max = 8)
```

### 

The [runif](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-random-deviates-of-uniform-distribution-in-r-programming-runif-function/) function creates a random uniform distribution between your chosen minimum and maximum values.

### Exercise 11

Run `tibble()`, set the argument `heads` equal to `rbinom()`, with the first argument `n` equal to `1000`, second argument `size` equal to `1`, and the third argument `prob` equal to `0.5`.

```{r distributions-11, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r distributions-11-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
tibble(heads = rbinom(n = ..., size = ..., prob = ...))
```

```{r distributions-11-test, include = FALSE}
tibble(heads = rbinom(n = 1000, size = 1, prob = 0.5))
```

### 

`rbinom()` is used for the scenario where there is only two possible outcome also known as Boolean data type, the coin toss in this case is an example of Boolean data. Within `rbinom()` the value `n` means how many values are drawn, `size` is how many values are drawn each time, and `prob` is the probability of the outcome (1).

### Exercise 12

We can give a quick look at what the graph looks like, pipe the `tibble()` from the previous code to `ggplot()`, within `ggplot()`, use `aes()` and set `x =  heads`, then add the layer `geom_bar()`. Set `binwidth` to `0.5`.

```{r distributions-12, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r distributions-12-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |>
  ggplot(aes(...)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = ...)
```

```{r distributions-12-test, include = FALSE}
tibble(heads = rbinom(n = 1000, size = 1, prob = 0.5)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = heads)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5)
```

### 

In this case `geom_col()` won't work because it needs a y aesthetic, `geom_bar()` is better than `geom_histogram()` in this scenario because `geom_bar()` automatically fixes the `binwidth` for you, while `geom_histogram()` requires you to set the `binwidth` yourself. 

### Exercise 13

Start a pipe with `tibble()`, create an value `Wshoes`, set it equal to `rnorm()`, set the first argument to `100000`, the second argument `mean` equal to `8`, and third argument `sd` to `1.5`. Create another value `Mshoes` in `tibble()`, set it equal to `rnorm()`, set the first argument to `100000`, the second argument `mean` equal to `10.5`, and third argument `sd` to `1.5`.

```{r distributions-13, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r distributions-13-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
tibble(Wshoes = rnorm(..., mean = ..., sd = ...),
       Mshoes = rnorm(..., mean = ..., sd = ...))
```

```{r distributions-13-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
tibble(Wshoes = rnorm(100000, mean = 8, sd = 1.5),
       Mshoes = rnorm(100000, mean = 10.5, sd = 1.5))
```

### 

Within `rnorm()` the first argument means how many times we are drawing, the second argument `mean` is the mean of the distribution, and the third argument `sd` is the standard deviation for the distribution. Normal distribution is mostly used for things that are very common for most people, but uncommon as they get far away from their average value. Examples could be height, blood pressure, IQ value, shoe sizes, etc.

### Exercise 14

Let's prepare to plot our tibble. Continue the pipe with `pivot_longer()`. Set `cols` to `everything()`, `names_to` to "Distribution", and `values_to` to  "draw".

```{r distributions-14, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r distributions-14-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
    pivot_longer(cols = ...,
                 names_to = ...,
                 values_to = ...)
```

```{r distributions-14-test, include = FALSE}
tibble(Wshoes = rnorm(100000, mean = 8, sd = 1.5),
       Mshoes = rnorm(100000, mean = 10.5, sd = 1.5)) |> 
          pivot_longer(cols = everything(),
                 names_to = "Distribution",
                 values_to = "draw")
```

### 

`pivot_longer()` "lengthens" data, increasing the number of rows and decreasing the number of columns. The inverse transformation is `pivot_wider()`

### Exercise 15

Continue your pipe with `ggplot()` to map `x` to `draw` and `fill` to `Distribution`. Add the layer `geom_histogram()`. Within `geom_histogram()`, inside `aes()`, set `y` equal to `after_stat()` with `count/sum(count)` as the argument.

```{r distributions-15, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r distributions-15-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...|>  
   ggplot(aes(x = ..., fill = ...)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(...)))
```

```{r distributions-15-test, include = FALSE}
tibble(Wshoes = rnorm(100000, mean = 8, sd = 1.5),

                geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))))
```

### Exercise 16

Using the previous code, set `alpha` to `0.5`, `bins` to `100`, and `position` to `"identity"` within `geom_histogram()`.

```{r distributions-16, exercise = TRUE}

```

### Exercise 17

Finally, use `labs()` to title your graph "Normal Distributions of shoe sizes". Also label your x-axis "Value" and y-axis "Probability".
```{r distributions-17, exercise = TRUE}

```

  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), 
               names_to = "distribution", 
               values_to = "value") |>  
   ggplot(aes(x = value, fill = distribution)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))),
                   alpha = 0.5, 
                   bins = 100,

    labs(title = "Normal Distributions of shoe sizes",
         x = "Value",
         y = "Probability")
```

Reminder: This is what your plot should look like.

Therefore, `after_stat()` is a function we use in the second stage, and it's family function `after_scale()` is used in the third stage. -->

## PD for rolling two dice
### 

<!-- DK: Sloppy work. Several of the questions should be broken up. -->

Let's create the following *empirical distribution* for rolling two dice.

```{r}
set.seed(1)

emp_dist_dice <- tibble(ID = 1:100) |> 
  mutate(die_1 = map_dbl(ID, ~ sample(c(1:6), size = 1))) |>

  mutate(sum = die_1 + die_2) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = sum)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))), 
                   binwidth = 1, 
                   color = "white") +
    labs(title = "Empirical Probability Distribution",
         subtitle = "Sum from rolling two dice, one hundred times",

         y = "Probability") +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2, 12, 1), labels = 2:12) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = 
                         scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
    theme_classic()

emp_dist_dice
```

### Exercise 1

Create a tibble with variable `ID`, equal to vector from 1 to 100.

```{r pd-for-rolling-two-dice-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r pd-for-rolling-two-dice-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
tibble(ID = ... : ...)
```

```{r pd-for-rolling-two-dice-1-test, include = FALSE}
tibble(ID = 1:100)
```

### 

The `tibble()` function provides us with a structure in which to organize the data which we generate.

### Exercise 2

Pipe the tibble to the `map_dbl()` function to create the results for an random dice rolling experiment. It will include two arguments, one is the data source, which in this case is `ID`, and the second is `~sample(c(1:6), size = 1)`.

```{r pd-for-rolling-two-dice-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>


```{r pd-for-rolling-two-dice-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...|>
map_dbl(ID, ~sample(c(...:...), size = 1))
```

```{r pd-for-rolling-two-dice-2-test, include = FALSE}
# tibble(ID = 1:100) |>
#                       map_dbl(ID, ~sample(c(1:6), size = 1))
```

This may return an error, but you may still continue on to the next exercise where the code should run without any errors.

### 

We use 1 through 6 to generate any one of the 6 sides of the dice. Size is one because we only want one side.

### Exercise 3

Now let's pipe the tibble to `mutate()`. Assign the `map_dbl` function we made above to an value called `die_1`.

```{r pd-for-rolling-two-dice-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r pd-for-rolling-two-dice-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
tibble(ID = 1:100) |>
                     mutate(... = map_dbl(ID, ~sample(c(1:6), size = 1)))
```

```{r pd-for-rolling-two-dice-3-test, include = FALSE}
tibble(ID = 1:100) |>
                     mutate(die_1 = map_dbl(ID, ~sample(c(1:6), size = 1)))
```

### Exercise 4

Now copy and paste the results from above, and do the exact same thing again but instead, change the name from `die_1` to `die_2`, because we need the results for two dices.

```{r pd-for-rolling-two-dice-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r pd-for-rolling-two-dice-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...|>
mutate(...,
       ... =map_dbl(ID, ~sample(c(...:...), size = 1)))
```

```{r pd-for-rolling-two-dice-4-test, include = FALSE}
tibble(ID = 1:100) |>
                     mutate(die_1 = map_dbl(ID, ~sample(c(1:6), size = 1)),
                            die_2 = map_dbl(ID, ~sample(c(1:6), size = 1)))
```

### Exercise 5

Use the `mutate()` function once again, name the value of the sum of `die_1` and `die_2` to `sum`.

```{r pd-for-rolling-two-dice-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r pd-for-rolling-two-dice-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...|>
mutate(...,
       ...,
       sum = die_1 + die_2)
```

```{r pd-for-rolling-two-dice-5-test, include = FALSE}
tibble(ID = 1:100) |>
                     mutate(die_1 = map_dbl(ID, ~sample(c(1:6), size = 1)),
                            die_2 = map_dbl(ID, ~sample(c(1:6), size = 1)),
                            sum = die_1+die_2)
```

### Exercise 6

Now use `ggplot()` to graph the Empirical Distribution, set `x = sum` within `aes()`, and then add a layer of `geom_histogram()`

```{r pd-for-rolling-two-dice-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r pd-for-rolling-two-dice-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}

ggplot(aes(...))+
  geom_histogram()

tibble(ID = 1:100) |>
                     mutate(die_1 = map_dbl(ID, ~sample(c(1:6), size = 1)),
                            die_2 = map_dbl(ID, ~sample(c(1:6), size = 1)),
                            sum = die_1+die_2) |>
                     ggplot(aes(x = sum)) + 
                      geom_histogram()
```

### Exercise 7

Within `geom_histogram()`, inside `aes()`, set the argument `y` equal to  `after_stat(count/sum(count))` to put percents on the y-axis.

```{r pd-for-rolling-two-dice-7, exercise = TRUE}

                            die_2 = map_dbl(ID, ~sample(c(1:6), size = 1)),
                            sum = die_1+die_2) |>
                     ggplot(aes(x = sum)) + 
                      geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))))
```

### Exercise 8

Also set `binwidth` to `0.5` and `color` to `"white"` within `geom_histogram()`.

```{r pd-for-rolling-two-dice-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```

```{r pd-for-rolling-two-dice-8-test}
tibble(ID = 1:100) |>
                     mutate(die_1 = map_dbl(ID, ~sample(c(1:6), size = 1)),
                            die_2 = map_dbl(ID, ~sample(c(1:6), size = 1)),
                            sum = die_1+die_2) |>
                     ggplot(aes(x = sum)) + 
                      geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))),
                                     binwidth = 0.5,
                                     color = "white")
```

### Exercise 9

Now use `scale_x_continuous()` so the x-axis has `breaks` to the sequence between 2 and 12 common difference is 1 using `seq()`. Set the `labels` for the breaks from 2 to 12.

```{r pd-for-rolling-two-dice-9, exercise = TRUE}

                            die_2 = map_dbl(ID, ~sample(c(1:6), size = 1)),
                            sum = die_1+die_2) |>
                     ggplot(aes(x = sum)) + 
                      geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))),
                                     binwidth = 0.5,
                                     color = "white") + 
                      scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2, 12, 1), labels = 2:12) 
```

### Exercise 10

Now use `scale_y_continuous()` to put the x-axis in percent format. Within `scale_y_continuous()`, set `labels` to `scales::percent_format()`. Within `percent_format()` set `accuracy` to `1`.

```{r pd-for-rolling-two-dice-10, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r pd-for-rolling-two-dice-10-test, include = FALSE}
tibble(ID = 1:100) |>
                     mutate(die_1 = map_dbl(ID, ~sample(c(1:6), size = 1)),
                            die_2 = map_dbl(ID, ~sample(c(1:6), size = 1)),

                      scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1))
```

### Exercise 11

Finally, use `labs()` to add the appropriate title, subtitle, and axis labels. Also add the layer `theme_classic()`.

```{r pd-for-rolling-two-dice-11, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

  mutate(die_2 = map_dbl(ID, ~ sample(c(1:6), size = 1))) |> 
  mutate(sum = die_1 + die_2) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = sum)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))), 
                   binwidth = 1, 
                   color = "white") +
    labs(title = "Empirical Probability Distribution",
         subtitle = "Sum from rolling two dice, replicated one hundred times",
         x = "Outcome\nSum of Two Die",
         y = "Probability") +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2, 12, 1), labels = 2:12) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = 
                         scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
    theme_classic()
```

Reminder: Your plot should look similar to the the one below.

<!-- ## Two models -->

<!-- Let's create the following *joint and conditional* probability tibble about Probaphobia. There is then a 50% chance that you test positive and a 50% chance you test negative. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->

<!-- ### Exercise 1 -->

<!-- Use `tibble()` and set `ID` from 1 to 10000. -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ```{r two-models-1-test, include = FALSE} -->
<!-- tibble(ID = 1:1000) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ###  -->

<!-- The first step is to simply create an tibble that consists of the simulated data we need to plot our distribution.  -->

<!-- ### Exercise 2 -->

<!-- Within `tibble()` set `have_disease` to `rep(c(TRUE, FALSE), 5000)`. -->

<!-- ```{r two-models-2, exercise = TRUE} -->

<!-- ###  -->

<!-- We have two different probabilities and they are completely separate from each other and we want to keep the two probabilities and the disease results in two and only two columns so that we can graph using the `ggplot()` function. -->

<!-- ### Exercise 3 -->

<!-- Start a pipe with the above code and `mutate()` with `positive_test` set to `if_else(have_disease)`. -->

<!-- ```{r two-models-3, exercise = TRUE} -->

<!-- ### Exercise 4 -->

<!-- Finally let's add two `map_int()`'s with `have_disease` and `rbinom()` into `if_else`. In `rbinom()` set `n` to 1, `size` to 1, and `prob` to `0.99` for the first and `0.5` for the second. -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ###  -->

<!-- We use the `rep` and `seq` functions when creating the table. The `seq` function sets the sequence we wants, in this case it is only two numbers, 0.01 (99% accuracy for testing negative if no disease, therefore 1% for testing positive if no disease) and 0.5 (50% accuracy for testing positive/negative if have disease), then we used the `rep` functions to repeat the process 10,000 times for each probability, in total 20,000 times. -->

<!-- Let's use the data from above to create a *conditional distribution*. -->

<!-- Add `geom_bar()` and within `aes()` set `y` to `after_stat(count/sum(count))`. -->

<!-- ###  -->

<!-- If we zoom in on the plot, about 70% of people who tested positive have the disease and 30% who tested positive do not have the disease. In this case, we are focusing on the one slice of the probability distribution where the test result was positive. -->

<!-- ### Exercise 14 -->

<!-- Let's add labels to this graph through `labs()`. Set `title` to "Posterior for Probaphobia Conditional on Positive Test", `x` to "Probaphobia Status", and `y` to "Probability". -->

<!-- ### Exercise 15 -->

<!-- Now we want to add `scale_x_discrete()`. Set `breaks` to `c(FALSE, TRUE)` and `labels` to `c("Healthy", "Infected")`. -->

<!-- ###  -->

<!-- There are two disease outcomes: positive or negative. By isolating a section, we are looking at a *conditional distribution*. Conditional on a positive test, you can visualize the likelihood of actually having the disease versus not. -->

<!-- ### Exercise 16 -->

<!-- Continue by adding `scale_y_continuous()` and set `labels` to `scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)`. -->

<!-- ```{r two-models-16, exercise = TRUE} -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ###  -->

<!-- With a positive test, you can be almost 70% sure that you have Probaphobia, however there is a good chance about 30% that you receive a false positive, so don’t worry too much there is still about a third of hope that you get the wrong result. -->

<!-- ### Exercise 1 -->

<!-- Create a tibble with one variable `in_bag`. Have `in_bag` take on the values of `rep()`. Within `rep()` use the arguments `0, 1, 2`.  -->

<!-- ### Exercise 3 -->

<!-- Pipe your code to the function `mutate()` to create the variable `heads`. Set `heads` to the function `map_int()`. The first argument to `map_int()` should be `p`. The second argument should be an `rbinom()` where `n` is set to 1, `size` is set to 20, and `p` is set to `.`. -->

<!-- ###  -->

<!-- `geom_jitter()` is a convenient shortcut for `geom_point(position = "jitter")`. It adds a small amount of random variation to the location of each point, and is a useful way of handling over-plotting caused by discreteness in smaller datasets. -->

<!-- ### Exercise 5 -->

<!-- ###  -->

<!-- Randomness creates (inevitable) tension between distribution as a “thing” and distribution as a vector of draws from that thing.

Yet, randomness means that the vector of draws will rarely match the mathematically “true” result. -->

<!--   scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, 1),  -->
<!--                      labels = c("Tails", "Heads")) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ###  -->

<!-- In our graph above, we use the function `scale_x_continuous()` because our x-axis variable is continuous, meaning it can take on any real values. The `breaks` argument to `scale_x_continuous()` converts our x-axis to having two different “tick marks”. There is a fairly even distribution of Tails and Heads. More draws would typically result in an even more equal split. -->

<!-- ### Exercise 7 -->

<!-- Copy the code from above and change `prob` to `0.75` within `rbinom()`. -->

<!--   scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, 1),  -->
<!--                      labels = c("Tails", "Heads")) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ###  -->

<!-- Here we can simulate an unfair coin, where the probability of landing on Heads was 0.75 instead of 0.25. -->

<!-- ### Exercise 8 -->

<!-- Copy the code from above and change the `scale_x_continuous()` to only include `breaks` which is set to `c(0,10)`. -->

## Wisdom
###

*All we can know is that we know nothing. And that’s the height of human wisdom.* - Leo Tolstoy



### Exercise 1

In your own words, describe the key components of Wisdom for working on a data science problem.

```{r wisdom-1}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "Wisdom requires the creation of a Preceptor Table, an examination of our data, and a determination, using the concept of validity, as to whether or not we can (reasonably!) assume that the two come from the same population.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

### Exercise 2

Define a Preceptor Table.

```{r wisdom-2}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "A Preceptor Table is the smallest possible table of data with rows and columns such that, if there is no missing data, it is easy to calculate the quantities of interest.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

One key aspect of a Preceptor Table is whether or not we need more than one potential outcome in order to calculate our estimand. For example, if we want to know the causal effect of exposure to Spanish-speakers on attitude toward immigration then we need a causal model, one which estimates that attitude for each person under both treatment and control. 

### Exercise 3

Describe the key components of Preceptor Tables in general. Use words like "units," "outcomes," and "covariates."

```{r wisdom-3}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "The rows of the Preceptor Table are the units. The outcome is at least one of the columns. If the problem is causal, there will be at least two (potential) outcome columns. The other columns are covariates. If the problem is causal, at least one of the covariates will be a treatment.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

### Exercise 4

<!-- need to include units/time -->

Write two sentences explaining a predictive model in your life. Include the one outcome variable of interest. 

```{r wisdom-4}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "A predictive model in my life can be seen as the money that I will potentially spend on groceries per week. I can take all of the data that I have from the previous weeks to estimate how much I will spend on groceries with a predictive model. Outcome: How much will I spend on groceries?",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

	
A predictive models has just one outcome column in its Preceptor Table.

### Exercise 5

Write two sentences explaining a causal model in your life. Include the two potential outcomes and the treatment variable. 

```{r wisdom-5}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "A causal model in my life can be seen as the money that I will spend on groceries based on whether I go to the gym to exercise. Two potential outcomes: dollars spent on groceries if I do go to the gym and dollars spent on groceries if I don't go to the gym. The treatment is going to the gym or not going to the gym. The following situation is an example of a causal model because there are two outcome columns in the Preceptor Table.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

Causal models aim to determine the effect of manipulating a specific variable on the outcome by comparing two or more potential outcomes for each unit. The difference between predictive models and causal models is that the former has one column for the outcome variable in the Preceptor Table and the latter has more than one column.

### Exercise 6

Scenario: You are an analyst at the mayor's office and want to find out what it will take for people to be more kind towards immigrants. You have previous data regarding individuals who were exposed to one of two possible conditions, and then their attitudes towards immigrants were recorded. One condition was waiting on a train platform near individuals speaking Spanish. The other was being on a train platform without Spanish-speakers. You are going to use this data and conduct your own analysis. You will give speeches on citizens through random assignment that includes a positive message regarding immigrants. Your hope is that the causal effect of those speeches is to make people be kinder. 

### 

Is this scenario a predictive model or a causal model? Explain why in two sentences.

```{r wisdom-6}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "This scenario is a causal model because there are multiple potential outcomes in the Preceptor Table. Causal models have more than one potential outcome while predictive models only have one outcome.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### Exercise 7

Let's create a Preceptor Table by finding each column needed from the scenario. Write two sentences about what the rows are of the situation and how it relates to the scenario.

```{r wisdom-7}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "We are going to use three rows: Citizens, Treatments, and Potential Outcomes. We are concerned about each citizen and the data that each one of them will contain.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### Exercise 8

What is the treatment for this problem?

```{r wisdom-8}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "Which citizens have heard the speech?",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```


### Exercise 9

Write two sentences about what the *potential outcomes* are of the situation and how it relates to the scenario. Remember this is a causal model which means that there will be multiple potential outcomes. 

```{r wisdom-9}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "Potential Outcomes: 
	           1. People who heard the speech and changed to be kind
	           2. People who heard the speech and changed to be not kind              3. People who didn't hear the speech and are kind
	           4. People who didn't hear the speech are not kind
	           These are the four potential outcomes at hand because of              the influence from the treatment that will change the                 outcome of the scenario.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### Exercise 10

In your own words, define "validity" as we use the term.

```{r wisdom-10}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "Validity is the consistency, or lack thereof, in the columns of the data set and the corresponding columns in the Preceptor Table.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

In order to consider the two datasets to be drawn from the same population, the columns from one must be have a valid correspondence with the columns in the other. 

### Exercise 11

Provide a reason why the *assumption of validity* might not hold with the data from immigrants with Spanish-speakers on the train to our scenario of giving citizens a speech to be more kind. Explain how that failure might impact the results.

```{r wisdom-11}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "The treatment in the data (Spanish speakers on a train platform) and the treatment in the Preceptor Table (a speech from the mayor about immigrants) are not similar enough that we can reasonably expect them to have the same causal effects. People are often annoyed by stangers but can react very differently to an elected official.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

*Validity*, if true (or at least reasonable), allows us to construct the Population Table.

## Justice
###

*The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.* - Theodore Parker


### Exercise 1

In your own words, name the four key components of Justice for working on a data science problem.

```{r justice-1}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "Justice concerns four topics: the Population Table, stability, representativeness, and unconfoundedness.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### Exercise 2

In your own words, define a Population Table.

```{r justice-2}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "The Population Table includes a row for each unit/time combination in the underlying population from which both the Preceptor Table and the data are drawn.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### Exercise 3

In your own words, define the assumption of "stability" when employed in the context of data science.

```{r justice-3}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "Stability means that the relationship between the columns in the Population Table is the same for three categories of rows: the data, the Preceptor Table, and the larger population from which both are drawn.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

Stability is all about *time*. Is the relationship among the columns in the Population Table stable over time? In particular, is the relationship --- which is another way of saying "mathematical formula" --- at the time the data was gathered the same as the relationship at the (generally later) time references by the Preceptor Table.

### Exercise 4

Scenario: You are an analyst at the mayor's office and want to find out what it will take for people to be more kind towards immigrants. You have previous data regarding individuals who were exposed to one of two possible conditions, and then their attitudes towards immigrants were recorded. One condition was waiting on a train platform near individuals speaking Spanish. The other was being on a train platform without Spanish-speakers. You are going to use this data and conduct your own analysis. You will give speeches on citizens through random assignment that includes a positive message regarding immigrants. Your hope is that the causal effect of those speeches is to make people be kinder. 

### 

Provide one reason why the assumption of stability might not be true in this case.

```{r justice-4}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "The assumption of stability might not hold because the relationship with our data (Spanish speakers on a train platform) and Preceptor Table (a speech from the mayor about immigrants) are not similar enough. ",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### Exercise 5

In your own words, define the assumption of "representativeness" when employed in the context of data science.

```{r justice-5}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "Representativeness, or the lack thereof, concerns two relationship, among the rows in the Population Table. The first is between the Preceptor Table and the other rows. The second is between our data and the other rows.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

Ideally, we would like both the Preceptor Table *and* our data to be random samples from the population. Sadly, this is almost never the case.

### Exercise 6

Provide one reason why the assumption of representativeness might not be true in this case.

```{r justice-6}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "The assumption of representatives might not be true because the sample of our data (Spanish speakers on a train platform) and Preceptor Table (a speech from the mayor about immigrants) are not random enough.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### Exercise 7

In your own words, define the assumption of "unconfoundedness" when employed in the context of data science.

```{r justice-7}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "Unconfoundedness means that the treatment assignment is independent of the potential outcomes, when we condition on pre-treatment covariates.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

This assumption is only relevant for causal models. We describe a model as "confounded" if this is not true.

### Exercise 8

In one sentence, provide a reason why the assumption of unconfoundedness would hold.

```{r justice-8}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "The assumption of unconfoundedness would hold because the sample of our data (Spanish speakers on a train platform) and Preceptor Table (a speech from the mayor about immigrants) are part of a causal model and we are randomly assigning treatment to the citizens.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

Unconfoundedness is related to the absence of confounding variables that may bias the relationship between the outcome variable and covariates. It implies that there are no hidden factors influencing both the treatment (if applicable) and the outcome.


## Courage
###

*Courage is the commitment to begin without any guarantee of success.* - Johann Wolfgang von Goethe

### Exercise 1

In your own words, describe the components of the virtue of Courage for analyzing data.

```{r courage-1}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "Courage begins with the exploration and testing of different models. It concludes with the creation of a Data Generating Mechanism.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```


## Temperance
### 

*Temperance to be a virtue must be free, and not forced.* - Philip Massinger

### Exercise 1

In your own words, describe the use of Temperance in finishing your data science project.

```{r temperance-1}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "Temperance uses the Data Generating Mechanism to answer the questions with which we began. Humility reminds us that this answer is always a lie. We can also use the DGM to calculate many similar quantities of interest, displaying the results graphically.",
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```
